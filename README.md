# Deep Project : NameCode LUMINA (LED Universal Matrix INterfAce)

## Context :
At the end of our 6th Semester at ESEO, we need to conduct an Hardware and Software project in C. We have decided to create the LUMINA project, which use a sqare LEDs matrix (from 2*2 to 16*16) to draw a bunch of fonctionnalities, here are few exemples : 

&rarr; Draw a character, with animation  <br />
&rarr; Using a pre-amplified sound sensor draw the sound spectrum using waves <br />

And many more in the future <br />

## Issues :
This project was initialy using the STM32F103C8T6 (Blue Pill), but due to technical and upload issues we switch to the STM32F103RB Dev Board
